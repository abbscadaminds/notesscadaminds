External monitoring is carried out by parties contracted at arms length from the project through third parties – e.g., government, or lenders and are always viewed as independent."

    "Is a pull-based system that uses local configuration to describe the endpoints to collect from and the interval desired for collection. Each endpoint has a client collecting the data and updating that representation upon each request (or however the client is configured). This data is collected and saved in a highly efficient storage engine on local disk. The storage system uses an append-only file per metric. This storage isn’t lossy, which means the fidelity of data from a year ago is as high as the data you are collecting today. However, you may not want to keep that much data locally. Fortunately, there is an option for remote storage for long-term retention and analysis.\n"
